# The-Inbox-Purger
If you're bad at checking ALL of your emails and are tired of seeing that huge number next to your
Gmail inbox, then it's your lucky day. This python script will automatically purge your inbox for you.
Hurray!!!!!

## Usage
Currently this script only works on Google Chrome. 

Before you can run the script, download the Google Chrome web driver. 
Download the latest release from http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. 
Put the web driver executable file in usr/bin or usr/local/bin directory of your computer.

You must also install Selenium. This can simply be done through the terminal using ...
```bash
pip install -U selenium
```

After the previous two installations 
make sure to input your Gmail username and password in the indicated fields of purge.py

Now simply run 
```bash
python purge.py
```
and sit back and enjoy the count of your unread emails go to ZERO :)
